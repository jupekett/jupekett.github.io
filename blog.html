            <h2>Renovation madness vs. inspiring studies</h2>

            <p>
              Being able to continue studying and working from home like normal
              even during Corona is something I'm thankful about. I feel that I
              haven't had to compromise my course choices or work performance at
              all. To add to the mix, our apartment is currently in the middle
              of a two-week renovation project. Luckily that hasn't had much 
              impact either, aside from being "moving house in-place" kind of a
              manoeuver. After this mild ordeal the boxes can finally be
              unpacked and spring enjoyed in an updated environment.

              Speaking of spring: plans for this semester's courses are looking great
              so far! Programming web-servers with python, learning DevSecOps
              practices, and dipping my toes in machine learning sure sound
              fascinating and useful. Can't wait to apply those future skills to
              practice.

            <p>
              For the moment, these stylesheets will do. The result is
              definitely not industry-worthy, but functional and personal enough
              for the time being. CSS always has some tricks I need to shake out
              of it's sleeve, but they start sticking once you stick around
              trying long enough. And thus my first personal general-use home
              page is out there for others to see.

              First version of the site is up. It has barebones front and
              portfolio pages. Next step is probably to neaten this up with CSS.
              But now, I think a walk with our dog Nano is in order. Some fresh
              air and recreation for both of us :)
