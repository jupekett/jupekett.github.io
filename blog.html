            <h2>Settling in the public cloud</h2>
            <p><span class="blog-timestamp">12.12.2021 23:07</span></p>
            <p>
              The past 6 months at Nordcloud Oy have been a great learning experience. I've heard people say things like
              "a year in working life equals <code>${multiplier}</code> years of studying", but that isn't wholly
              accurate. Yes, there are a plethora of technologies, processes and facets of customer work that cannot fit
              in a curriculum. Here are some things I've faced in the wild for the first time:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Production codebases</li>
              <li>
                Deployment technologies, such as Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, CDK, Terraform
              </li>
              <li>
                AWS serverless tech: Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, API Gateway, Route53, Cloudfront
              </li>
              <li>Azure stuff: App Service, WebJobs</li>
              <li>
                Cloud debugging tools: AWS CloudWatch & X-Ray, Azure App Insights
              </li>
              <li>Jira, service desks</li>
              <li>Recurring meetings with customers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              On the other hand, touchpoints to some of these technologies might temporarily be narrow and driven by
              necessity and practicality. University courses often handle a subject at a more fundamental level than
              skimming through documentation and "learning as you go" during everyday tasks. I've laid my groundwork
              there, and now I am able to put my skills to practice while making a difference as a part of my team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Luckily, my expertise will only grow over time. We are also encouraged to study the cloud giants at a
              certificate level by giving access to learning platforms, and setting growth plans. I anticipate an
              exciting near future for me, and will do my best to be worth the expectations.

            <h2>To the clouds and beyond</h2>
            <p><span class="blog-timestamp">5.3.2021 21:02</span></p>
            <p>
              The coming summer will be one of constant learning and brand new exciting challenges, as I received a new
              job! I won't disclose the position quite yet, but I will once I start working officially. That said, the
              title of this blog post might be a subtle hint about the branch of IT I will be focusing on. I'm humbled
              and relieved, because then I can put to test everything I have learned so far, and "conquer some new
              frontiers".
            </p>
            <p>
              This being the case, I'm taking some of my portfolio projects on AWS offline in order to save money. The
              fees have not been substantial, but any savings are good.
            </p>
            <p>I wish you an inspiring and warm spring!</p>

            <h2>Renovation madness vs. inspiring studies</h2>
            <p><span class="blog-timestamp">22.1.2021 17:03</span></p>
            <p>
              Being able to continue studying and working from home like normal even during Corona is something I'm
              thankful about. I feel that I haven't had to compromise my course choices or work performance at all. To
              add to the mix, our apartment is currently in the middle of a two-week renovation project. Luckily that
              hasn't had much impact either, aside from being "moving house in-place" kind of a manoeuver. After this
              mild ordeal the boxes can finally be
              unpacked and spring enjoyed in an updated environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking of spring: plans for this semester's courses are looking great so far! Programming web-servers
              with python, learning DevSecOps practices, and dipping my toes in machine learning sure sound fascinating
              and useful. Can't wait to apply those future skills to practice.

            <h2>Maybe visually out-of-date, but functional</h2>

            <p>
              For the moment, these stylesheets will do. The result is definitely not industry-worthy, but functional
              and personal enough for the time being. CSS always has some tricks I need to shake out of it's sleeve, but
              they start sticking once you stick around trying long enough. And thus my first personal general-use home
              page is out there for others to see.

              First version of the site is up. It has barebones front and portfolio pages. Next step is probably to
              neaten this up with CSS. But now, I think a walk with our dog Nano is in order. Some fresh air and
              recreation for both of us :)
