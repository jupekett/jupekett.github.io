              For the moment, these stylesheets will do. The result is
              definitely not industry-worthy, but functional and personal enough
              for the time being. CSS always has some tricks I need to shake out
              of it's sleeve, but they start sticking once you stick around
              trying long enough. And thus my first personal general-use home
              page is out there for others to see.

              First version of the site is up. It has barebones front and
              portfolio pages. Next step is probably to neaten this up with CSS.
              But now, I think a walk with our dog Nano is in order. Some fresh
              air and recreation for both of us :)
