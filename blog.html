            <h2>Translating source code? Madness</h2>
            <p><span class="blog-timestamp">7.1.2023 11:06</span></p>
            <h3>Local vs global</h3>
            <p>
              So, I decided to translate the UI for one of my old portfolio applications, <a href="portfolio.html#react">Othello</a>,
              to english.
              Like most of my programming exercises from JYU, this game was coded entirely in finnish.
              Previously I felt somewhat awkward presenting that application to an unknown audience, knowing that the UI
              was not created with future observers in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aaand done! End of blog post. But when I saw the recently translated interface elements in between all the finnish variables, I was torn:
              bilingual source code <em>really</em> doesn't look good!
              Then I knew I had to do the unthinkable: <strong>translate all the source code</strong>, for my own
              sake...
              and hopefully to the benefit of the occasional non-finnish reader.
            </p>
            <h3>Into the fray</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="https://gitlab.jyu.fi/jupekett/othello-react/-/blob/e0fe5c00ebb40dc1cc185e9d1fd1dbee5f030b2a/js/scripts.js">1700 lines of JS</a> in total.
              At first the task didn't seem so bad. Just let IDE do the heavy lifting, right?
              <strong>JetBrains WebStorm</strong> has convenient refactoring capabilities after all.
              But at some point I noticed that not every necessary change is detected out of the box:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>React prop names that are passed between components</li>
              <li>React state object properties for state updates</li>
              <li>inline <code>cssText</code> in JavaScript files</li>
              <li>any string interpolation shenanigans</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This resulted in the application breaking entirely maybe 20% of the way in. Woe is me!
              But that point was kind of liberating. Now I could - with good conscience - use oldschool regular
              expressions and search-replace with wild abandon.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>...<a href="https://gitlab.jyu.fi/jupekett/othello-react/-/commit/c8c1152fc448e90e08075a9c678a64a5276dc0da">hacking away</a> trying not to chop off any major limbs...</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              And finally the application springs back to life! A moment of relief, for sure.
            </p>
            <h3>Polishing. Polerowanie? Almost un-finnished...</h3>
            <p>
              After first translation pass I came across and fixed some bugs I had introduced by altering string
              templates and typo'ed variable names.
              CSS style usage was pretty minimal, so <a href="https://gitlab.jyu.fi/jupekett/othello-react/-/commit/6f9910d99f7ee40f07846d97d1fed5e76d4e6c67">that part</a> was fast.
              Although it felt like a slog, revisiting
              <a href="https://gitlab.jyu.fi/jupekett/othello-react/-/commit/10ce60b0922c18eca776638559f8baa00cf06574">documentation</a>
              <a href="https://gitlab.jyu.fi/jupekett/othello-react/-/commit/fb405e44dd8fa900781a8f2750cb8c6f0acafd2b">comments</a>
              was also a nice reminder of what was going through my mind back in 2020 during the exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of my troubles could probably have been avoided with proper IDE configuration, usage of <strong>React
              PropTypes</strong>, a suite of unit tests, etc. But at least now this old project is more presentable than before.
              It was a great opportunity for minor improvements, such as adding specificity to ambiguous variable names.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em><strong>If it works, don't touch it</strong></em>.
              I've understood that these are usually the words to live by when working with large production codebases.
              I would be hard-pressed to repeat this same translation exercise to one of those.
              Addressing technical debt through thoughtful refactoring is another story.
              Even if non-physical, software requires care and maintenance to ensure its value in the long term.
              Speaking of which, another portfolio project has (again) stopped working after a 3rd party data source became unavailable...
            </p>
            <h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
            <p>
              When I first began learning the basics of programming, I found that using my native tongue is useful in maintaining a
              mental distinction between programming language keywords and my own definitions.
              These days I appreciate international cooperation more, though, thanks to working in
              multinational software teams at <a href="https://nordcloud.com/">Nordcloud</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This application's UI is still rudimentary, React idioms outdated, and structure constrained
              by the CDN version of React not allowing modularization.
              Still, I'm proud that I figured out the core logic back then.
              I especially enjoyed dialing in the game loop and calculating legal moves for each turn.
              Maybe I'm more backend kind of guy  than a frontend maestro?
            </p>
            <p>
              Some old portfolio projects remain fully finnish, but I likely won't touch them at this point.
              I'll rather create new works with modern tech, fresh insights and updated skills.
              I have some ideas brewing.
              Maybe this very site will finally receive a frontend framework as its core...
            </p>
            <h3>PS</h3>
            <p>
              I introduced a small frontend improvement to portfolio page by adding fade-in-n-out for image previews.
              Cheers!

            <h2>Settling in the public cloud</h2>
            <p><span class="blog-timestamp">12.12.2021 23:07</span></p>
            <p>
              The past 6 months at Nordcloud Oy have been a great learning experience. I've heard people say things like
              "a year in working life equals <code>${multiplier}</code> years of studying", but that isn't wholly
              accurate. Yes, there are a plethora of technologies, processes and facets of customer work that cannot fit
              in a curriculum. Here are some things I've faced in the wild for the first time:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Production codebases</li>
              <li>
                Deployment technologies, such as Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, CDK, Terraform
              </li>
              <li>
                AWS serverless tech: Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, API Gateway, Route53, Cloudfront
              </li>
              <li>Azure stuff: App Service, WebJobs</li>
              <li>
                Cloud debugging tools: AWS CloudWatch & X-Ray, Azure App Insights
              </li>
              <li>Jira, service desks</li>
              <li>Recurring meetings with customers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              On the other hand, touchpoints to some of these technologies might temporarily be narrow and driven by
              necessity and practicality. University courses often handle a subject at a more fundamental level than
              skimming through documentation and "learning as you go" during everyday tasks. I've laid my groundwork
              there, and now I am able to put my skills to practice while making a difference as a part of my team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Luckily, my expertise will only grow over time. We are also encouraged to study the cloud giants at a
              certificate level by giving access to learning platforms, and setting growth plans. I anticipate an
              exciting near future for me, and will do my best to be worth the expectations.

            <p>
              The coming summer will be one of constant learning and brand new exciting challenges, as I received a new
              job! I won't disclose the position quite yet, but I will once I start working officially. That said, the
              title of this blog post might be a subtle hint about the branch of IT I will be focusing on. I'm humbled
              and relieved, because then I can put to test everything I have learned so far, and "conquer some new
              frontiers".
            </p>
            <p>
              This being the case, I'm taking some of my portfolio projects on AWS offline in order to save money. The
              fees have not been substantial, but any savings are good.
            </p>
            <p>I wish you an inspiring and warm spring!</p>

            <h2>Renovation madness vs. inspiring studies</h2>
            <p><span class="blog-timestamp">22.1.2021 17:03</span></p>
            <p>
              Being able to continue studying and working from home like normal even during Corona is something I'm
              thankful about. I feel that I haven't had to compromise my course choices or work performance at all. To
              add to the mix, our apartment is currently in the middle of a two-week renovation project. Luckily that
              hasn't had much impact either, aside from being "moving house in-place" kind of a maneuver. After this
              mild ordeal the boxes can finally be
              unpacked and spring enjoyed in an updated environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking of spring: plans for this semester's courses are looking great so far! Programming web-servers
              with python, learning DevSecOps practices, and dipping my toes in machine learning sure sound fascinating
              and useful. Can't wait to apply those future skills to practice.

            <p>
              For the moment, these stylesheets will do. The result is definitely not industry-worthy, but functional
              and personal enough for the time being. CSS always has some tricks I need to shake out of it's sleeve, but
              they start sticking once you stick around trying long enough. And thus my first personal general-use home
              page is out there for others to see.

            <p>
              First version of the site is up. It has barebones front and portfolio pages. Next step is probably to
              neaten this up with CSS. But now, I think a walk with our dog Nano is in order. Some fresh air and
              recreation for both of us :)
